## Inspired at GDG relay online mogagko(모각코)

[GDG Online 모각코](https://sites.google.com/view/code-with-gdgkr/home)

모각코는 "모여서 각자 코딩"의 줄임말입니다.

## Motivation

2020년 9월 GDG 온라인 모각코를 몇 차례 참여하고 난 후에 여러가지 생각을 하게 됐습니다.

- 역시 계획적인 시간 보내기는 뿌듯하다.
- 언젠가 해야 하는 것들에 대한 자신의 게으름을 탓하지 않게 된다.
- 내 멘토링의 철학인 시간 계획 + 목표 + 수행 + 결과 정리와 크게 다르지 않다.

그래서 저도 온라인 모각코 모임을 만들어 보게 되었습니다.

## Overview

매주 토요일 오전 10시 30분에서 12시 30분 까지 2시간 집중해서 오전에 공부를 하는 모임입니다.
공부를 해도 좋고 코딩을 해도 좋고 뭘 해도 좋습니다. 다만 회사일이나 개인적으로 마감 때문에 급하게 처리해야 하는 일은 최대한 자제해 주시면 좋겠습니다.

그런데 일로 하는건 둘째 치고 아무것도 안하는 것 보다 계획된 시간에 뭔가 한다는게 중요합니다. 그래서 이 모임이 의미가 있다고 생각하고 있습니다.

## Features

- 참여는 자율입니다. 즉, 하기로 했는데 안와도 상관 없고, 아무 얘기도 안했는데 토요일 오전 10시 30분에 들어오셔도 상관 없습니다.
- 아무 얘기도 안하고 들어왔을 경우라고 해도 아래 process에 대한 룰은 지켜야 합니다.
- "XX 때문에 못와서 죄송합니다.", "다음에 꼭 참여할께요" 등 불필요한 변명은 안해도 됩니다. 자율 모임이라 누가 오던 안오던 상관 없는 모임입니다. 각자 알아서 하는 모임이니까요.

## Known rewards

- 보통 인맥 네트워킹이 가장 크고
- 그 다음에 서로 관심이 없더라도 어쩌다가 알게되는 기술적인 교류
- 더 발전하게 된다면 마음 맞는 사람들 끼리의 팀 프로젝트까지 발전 가능합니다.

## Special rewards

- 2시간을 다 채우고 인증이 완료된 분에게 참석 스탬프 1장을 드립니다.
  - [추가 업데이트) 2021-10-18](https://github.com/ThinkAboutSoftware/OnlineSelfCodingGroup/issues/86)
  - 참석 하신 분이 한 분 혹은 두 분 이라면 그 분에게는 스탬프를 2장 드립니다!
- 스탬프 4장을 모으신 분은 저의 사비를 털어 스타벅스 아메리카노 쿠폰을 드립니다.
- 기념이 될 만한 회차 ([10회](https://github.com/ThinkAboutSoftware/OnlineSelfCodingGroup/issues/18), [50회](https://github.com/ThinkAboutSoftware/OnlineSelfCodingGroup/issues/88), 100회 등)에 참여하신 분은 쿠폰이 업그레이드 됩니다!
- 인증 절차
  - 아래 모든 내용은 제가 확인하고 진행합니다.
  - 10시 30분 ~ 10시 40분 사이 입장, 각자 자기 소개 혹은 할 내용에 대해 소개 하신 분
  - 12시 30분 ~ 12시 40분 사이 꺼뒀던 마이크를 켜고 자유로운 대화에 참여하신 분
  - 이후 진행한 내용에 대한 링크를 시작하기 전 작성한 issue에 업데이트: 다음 모각코 전까지 확인되어야 함

## Process

### Before join

- 참석 여부에 대한 표시를 위해 이번 주 모각코 issue글에 스스로 assignee에 자기 자신을 할당한다.
- 이번 모각코에서 뭘 할지에 대한 목표를 간략하지만 명확하게 2시간 분량의 양이라는 걸 이해할 수 있도록 모각코 issue 글에 코멘트로 적는다.
  - 좋은예) 수학과 함께하는 A.I 기초 책 챕터 2-2 부분 읽고 예제 파일 2개 코딩하고 github에 올리기
  - 안좋은예) 수학과 함께하는 A.I 기초 책 읽고 공부하기

### Joined

- 매주 토요일 오전 10시 30분에 아래 google meet 링크를 통해 접속
  - [Google meet](https://meet.google.com/jyx-mxnq-kpk)
  - 공부 진행중에는 마이크는 반드시 꺼야 함
  - 모인 사람들이 진행할 내용에 대한 얘기를 듣기 위해 스피커를 켜 둬야 함.
- 간단히 자기가 진행할 공부 내용에 대한 소개 진행
  - 자기 소개 포함
  - 새로온 멤버가 없다면 자기소개는 넘어갈 수 있음
- 각자 알아서 공부 진행

### Finish

- 12시 30분 이후 10분 정도 발언 시간 진행
  - 각자 진행했던 내용에 대해 공유나 얘기하고 싶으신 분, 없으면 생략 가능
  - 다른 사람이 한 내용 대해 관심 있거나 물어보고 싶으신 분 질문/답변 시간, 없으면 생략 가능
  - 제가 TMI 여서 10분이 너무 빨리 지나갑니다. 어색할 틈이 없어요.
- 2시간 동안 한 분량에 대해 이번주 모각코 issue 글에 추가 코멘트로 정리, 모각코가 끝난 12시 30분 이후에 해도 상관 없음.
  - 작업 내용이 자신의 개인 github이나 블로그 등 다른 곳에 있다면 그 부분에 대한 링크 첨부
  - 책읽기의 경우 페이지 분량 표시
  - 유튜브 강의 시청이면 어떤 영상을 봤는지 링크 첨부 등
  - 구글 검색하고 삽질한거 밖에 없다고 해도 어떤 걸 검색했는지와 유용하다고 생각한 검색 결과 링크 첨부
- 최종 확인이 완료되면 [스탬프 현황 페이지](/Stamp/)에 스탬프 1장 발급해 드립니다.

## Remind

- 매주 같은 시간에 안할 경우가 있으므로 그 때는 미리 issue를 통해 변경 시간 확인
- github에서 참여가 확인되면 최대한 빨리 메일을 통해 구글 캘린더 일정에 추가해 드립니다
- 참여 수락한 이후, 해당 시간에 참여할 때 저의 참여요청 승인을 받지 않아도 자유롭게 입장할 수 있습니다.
- 2021-02-21 추가) 만약 제가 10시 5분 이후에도 참석하지 않으면 늦잠을 자고 있는 것이므로 여러분들끼리 긴급 google meet 링크를 생성 후 진행해 주시면 좋겠습니다.
  - 이미 [사고](https://github.com/ThinkAboutSoftware/OnlineSelfCodingGroup/issues/23) 사례가 있기 때문에 미리 죄송하다는 말씀 드립니다.
