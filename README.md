## Inspired at GDG relay online mogagko(모각코)

[GDG Online 모각코](https://sites.google.com/view/code-with-gdgkr/home)

모각코는 "모여서 각자 코딩"의 줄임말입니다.

## Motivation

2020년 9월 GDG 온라인 모각코를 몇 차례 참여하고 난 후에 여러가지 생각을 하게 됐습니다.

- 역시 계획적인 시간 보내기는 뿌듯하다.
- 언젠가 해야 하는 것들에 대한 자신의 게으름을 탓하지 않게 된다.
- 내 멘토링의 철학인 시간 계획 + 목표 + 수행 + 결과 정리와 크게 다르지 않다.

그래서 저도 온라인 모각코 모임을 만들어 보게 되었습니다.

## Overview

매주 토요일 오전 10시 30분에서 12시 30분 까지 2시간 집중해서 오전에 공부를 하는 모임입니다.
공부를 해도 좋고 코딩을 해도 좋고 뭘 해도 좋습니다. 다만 회사일이나 개인적으로 마감 때문에 급하게 처리해야 하는 일은 최대한 자제해 주시면 좋겠습니다.

그런데 일로 하는건 둘째 치고 아무것도 안하는 것 보다 계획된 시간에 뭔가 한다는게 중요합니다. 그래서 이 모임이 의미가 있다고 생각하고 있습니다.

## Features

- 참여는 자율입니다. 즉, 하기로 했는데 안와도 상관 없고, 아무 얘기도 안했는데 토요일 오전 10시 30분에 들어오셔도 상관 없습니다.
- 아무 얘기도 안하고 들어왔을 경우라고 해도 아래 process에 대한 룰은 지켜야 합니다.
- "XX 때문에 못와서 죄송합니다.", "다음에 꼭 참여할께요" 등 불필요한 변명은 안해도 됩니다. 자율 모임이라 누가 오던 안오던 상관 없는 모임입니다. 각자 알아서 하는 모임이니까요.
